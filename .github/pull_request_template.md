<!---
Please create an issue and discuss the issue which is promting your change
before opening a pull request.

In general, we're not going to accept pull requests for new features if they
would be a significant breaking change, if they have the potential to
significantly impact build performance, or if they introduce
new dependencies for the repository.

Please note, this is a fork of an internal repository.
Pull requests may be rejected simply because pulling the change into our
internal repository would be too complicated.
